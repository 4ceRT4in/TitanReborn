<h1 align="center">Prepare to battle! - Titan Reborn brings unique materials with special perks, essence infusing, and much more to player-versus-player combat!<br></h1>

![Features](https://cdn-raw.modrinth.com/data/9K53v0ys/images/cb7337a3f4a243e3186132bb504b2d118a01cd72.png)

üìú **About** üìú
---

Titan Reborn introduces 3 unique materials, found in the Overworld and Nether, each granting distinct buffs upon the player. These materials encourage strategic decision-making as players choose the material their weapons and armor parts are made of, to prioritize certain buffs, adding depth and variety to their gameplay experience.

üß™ **Citrin**: As a common and slightly stronger material than iron in durability and protection, this material protects the player from any form of bad potion effects, reducing effect time and chance for damage ticks when being affected. 

üî• **Ember**: A hellish material from the realms of the nether. This material stops lava, fire and magma damage, reducing burn time and chance for damage ticks when on fire. Its upgraded form, netherite armor, has been reworked to feature infinite resistance when wearing a full set.

üíú **Titan**: As the strongest material, Titan can only scarcely be found in the depths of the deepslate layer. Each armor piece grants the player extra health, resulting in up to 5 hearts when wearing a full set. It is also unbreakable and highly enchantable.

- **Greatswords**\
