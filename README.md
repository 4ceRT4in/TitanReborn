<h1 align="center">Prepare to battle! - Titan Reborn brings unique materials with special perks, essence infusing, and much more to player-versus-player combat!<br></h1>

![Features](https://cdn-raw.modrinth.com/data/9K53v0ys/images/cb7337a3f4a243e3186132bb504b2d118a01cd72.png)

**New Materials**
---

Titan Reborn introduces 3 unique materials to both the Overworld and the Nether, each granting distinct buffs upon the player. These materials encourage strategic decision-making as players choose the material their weapons and armor parts are made off, to prioritize certain buffs, adding depth and variety to their gameplay experience.

🧪 **Citrin**: As a common and slightly stronger material than iron in durability and protection, this material protects the player from any form of bad potion effects, reducing effect time and chance for damage ticks when being affected. 

🔥 **Ember**: A hellish material from the realms of the nether. This material stops lava, fire and magma damage, reducing burn time and chance for damage ticks when on fire. Its upgraded form, netherite armor, has been reworked to feature infinite resistance when wearing a full set.

💜 **Titan**: As the strongest material, Titan can only scarcily be found in the depths of the deepslate layer. Each armor piece grants the player extra health, resulting in up to 5 hearts when wearing a full set. It is also unbreakable and highly enchantable.

**Close Range Combat**
---
- **Swords**\
=> Lower damage, no cooldown, 1.2x crit modifier, easier crafting, better enchantability
- **Greatswords**\
=> Higher damage, custom cooldown, 1.5x crit modifier, harder crafting, worse enchantability

- **Essences**\
=> Imbue swords with Wither, Weakness, Poison, Blindness, or Fire essences (a essence adds +25% chance, max chance of 50%)

- **Nether Armor**\
=> Immune to fire, magma, and lava damage by chance (25/50/75/100% chance depending on worn armor parts)
- **Titan Armor**\
